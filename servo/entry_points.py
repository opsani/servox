# Entry points for executing functionality defined in other modules
# This wrapping is necessary for keeping Docker builds fast because
# the entry points must be present on the filesystem during package
# installation in order to be registered on the path and fast moving
# sources will unnecessarily bust the Docker cache and trigger full
# reinstalls of all package dependencies.
# Do not implement meaningful functionality here. Instead import and
# dispatch the intent into focused modules to do the real work.
