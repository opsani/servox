    Transform a function or method into a check.

    Checks are used to test the availability, readiness, and health of resources and
    services that used during optimization. The `Check` class models the status of a
    check that has been run. The `check` function is a decorator that transforms a
    function or method that returns a `bool`, `str`, `Tuple[bool, str]`, or `None`
    into a check function or method.

    The decorator requires a `name` parameter to identify the check as well as an optional
    informative `description`, an `id` for succinctly referencing the check, and a `severity`
    value that determines how failure is reported and affects depdendent checks.
    The body of the decorated function is used to perform the business logic of running
    the check. The decorator wraps the original function body into a handler that runs the
    check and marshalls the value returned or exception caught into a `Check` representation.
    The `run_at` and `runtime` properties are automatically set, providing execution timing of
    the check. The signature of the transformed function is `() -> Check`.

    Args:
        name: Human readable name of the check.

    have an arbitrary number of prerequisites and options that need to be
    checked within the runtime environment. The BaseChecks class provides a simple
    inheritance based interface for implementing an arbitrary number of checks.

    Checks are implemented through standard instance methods that are prefixed
    with `check_`, accept no arguments, and return an instance of `Check`. The method
    body tests a single aspect of the configuration (rescuing exceptions as necessary)
    and returns a `Check` object that models the results of the check performed.

    Checks are executed in method definition order within the subclass (top to bottom).
    Check methods can be implemented synchronously or asynchronously. Methods that are
    declared as coroutines via the `async def` syntax are run asynchronously.

    By default, check execution is halted upon encountering a failure. This behavior
    allows the user to assume that the runtime environment described by preceding
    checks has been established and implement a narrowly scoped check. Halting execution
    can be overridden via the `halt_on` argument.

    Building a checks subclass implementation with this function is semantically equivalent to

    Some connector types such as metrics system integrations wind up exposing collections

    collection of queries against Prometheus. Each query really should be validated for
    correctness early and often, but this can become challenging to manage, audit, and enforce
    as the collection grows and entropy increases. Key challenges include non-obvious
    evolution within the collection and developer fatigue from boilerplate code maintenance.
    This function provides a remedy for these issues by wrapping these sorts of collections into
    fully featured classes that are integrated into the servo checks system.

    """Expand a method into a sequence of checks from a returned iterable and
    check handler.

    This method provides an alternative to `create_checks_from_iterable` that is
    usable in cases where it is desirable to implement a `BaseChecks` subclass
    to hand-roll specific checks but there are also iterable values that can be
    checked by a common handler.

    The decorator works by dynamically creating check instance methods when a
    `BaseChecks` subclass is initialized.

    The decorator requires a `base_name` parameter to identify the checks as
    well as an optional informative `description`, a `severity` value that
    determines how a failure is handled. The `base_name` is interpolated into an
    item specific name by formatting the `base_name` with an item from the
    iterable collection. The item is passed to format as the `item` key,
    enabling the use of property access and subscripting within the format
    string.

    The decorated function must return an iterable collection of objects to be
    checked and a handler function for checking each value.

    Args:
        base_name: Human readable base name of the check. Expanded with each iterable.
        description: Optional additional details about the checks.
        severity: The severity level of failure.
        tags: An optional list of tags for filtering checks. Tags may contain only lowercase
            alphanumeric characters, hyphens '-', and periods '.'.

    Returns:
        A decorator function for transforming a method into a series of check instance methods.

    Raises:
        TypeError: Raised if the signature of the decorated function is incompatible.
