# CHANGELOG

Servo is an Open Source framework supporting Continuous Optimization of
infrastructure and applications via the Opsani optimization engine. Opsani
provides a software as a service platform that optimizes the resourcing and
configuration of cloud native applications to reduce operational costs and
increase performance. Servo instances are responsible for connecting the
optimizer service with the application under optimization by linking with the
metrics system (e.g. Prometheus, Thanos, DataDog, etc) and the orchestration
system (e.g. Kubernetes, CloudFormation, etc) in order to apply changes and
evaluate their impact on cost and performance.

Servo is distributed under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.

This changelog catalogs all notable changes made to the project. The format is
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). Releases are
versioned in accordance with [Semantic
Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.9.0] "serenity now" - Unreleased

### Added

- Incorporated [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop) for faster async
  event loops.

### Changed

- The `__codename__` support has been generalized as `cryptonym` attribute for
  all connectors.
- Version output now includes the cryptonym.

### Fixed

- Local versions are now resolved via the `pyproject.toml` file to accurately
  reflect pre-release versioning and local work in progress.

## [0.8.3] "pass the calamari" - 2020-10-21

### Fixed

- Initialize Kubernetes optimizations before taking a measurement. This ensures
  that the Kubernetes Connector has an opportunity to set up the environment
  before a measurement is taken that is reliant on the setup (e.g. all canaries
  have been created).

## [0.8.2] "pass the calamari" - 2020-10-16

### Added

- Connectors can now be dynamically added and removed from the servo via the
  `servo.servo.Servo` methods `add_connector` and `remove_connector`.
- Individual checks can now be run by ID or name via the
  `servo.checks.BaseChecks.run_one` method.
- Developer Makefile tasks `format`, `lint`, and `test`.
- Introduced pre-commit hooks for enforcing style guides and engineering
  standards.

### Changed

- Code across the library is now referenced by package and module rather than
  importing individual classes and functions. This reduces the amount of
  boilerplate code in any given module and makes the code more accessible by
  making implicit references explicit and unambiguous.
- Simplified `servo.logging.ProgressHandler` implementation with an asyncio
  queue and producer/consumer pattern.
- Renamed `servo.checks.BaseChecks.run_` method to
  `servo.checks.BaseChecks.run_all`.
- Renamed the `filter_` argument of check runners to `matching`.
- Millicore values are now serialized to strings as simple integers when evenly
  divisible by 1000 (e.g., `str(Millicore(3000)) == "3"`).
- The canonical coding style for the project has been evolved to directly import
  packages and modules instead of class and functions.

### Fixed

- `servo show components` now includes the setting names instead of naked
  values.
- Type resolution (used in eventing and checks) is now able to flexibly handle
  arbitrary imports path and type aliases.
- Settlement time can now be supplied to adjust operations by the optimizer via
  the `servo.types.Control` type.
- Before and after event handlers are no longer invoked with extraneous
  arguments from the on event definition.

## [0.8.1] "pass the calamari" - 2020-10-02

Maintenance release to remove development packages from Docker images.

### Changed

- Reworked Docker build automation to decouple from release process.
- Fixed breakage in production builds.
- Updated Poetry dependency to v1.1.0 in Dockerfile.

## [0.8.0] "pass the calamari" - 2020-10-02

### Added

- `servo.__codename__` constant now contains the release codename.
- Extensive docstring comments for all members of the `servo.types` module.
- Kubernetes Containers can be aliased to set explicit Compomnent names rather
  rather than automatically deriving names from Deployment/Container.
- Kubernetes Optimization Strategy classes can now accept options from the
  config file (currently supports `alias` for canaries).
- Integrated orjson to gain control over JSON/YAML serialization for classes
  that inherit from built-in types (e.g., str, int, float).
- The `ProgressHandler` now handles exceptions and optionally notifies an
  external exception handler.
- Servo will now interrupt operations when it detects losing sync with the
  backend by encountering unexpected operation errors.
- Critical checks can be declared via the `require` decorator.
- Added the `warn` decorator for creating checks that emit warnings rather than
  failing.

### Removed

- Subprocess methods have been removed from `servo.connector.Connector` in favor
  of directly importing the subprocess module from the utilities module.
- The `required` attribute from the `servo.checks` module in favor of
  `severity`.

### Changed

- The `servo.logging` module has been generalized for use outside of the
  `servo.connectors.Connector` inheritance hierarchy.
- The active connector is now managed via a `ContextVar` just as the active
  event is. This enables logging to correctly be attributed to the active
  connector without having to pass a specific logger object around everywhere.
- The `servo.types.Setting` class has been significantly overhauled:
  - Setting is now an abstract base class
  - RangeSetting models range settings
  - EnumSetting models enum settings
  - Introduce CPU, Memory, Replicas, and InstanceType settings for special
    optimizer settings
  - Validate numerous behaviors (range inclusion, enum inclusion, type
    agreement, etc)
- JSON and YAML serializations now favor human readable representations by
  default whenever possible.
- Multicheck methods now yield more readable IDs based off the parent multicheck
  method name (e.g., `check_resource_requirements_item_0`).
- Checks now have a severity described by the `servo.checks.Severity`
  enumeration, replacing required.
- Required check nomenclature has been replaced with the `critical` severity
  level to clarify expectations and eliminate ambiguity in check behavior.

### Fixed

- Progress tracking now handles zero length durations appropriately (e.g., in
  warmup, settlement, etc).
- Model objects that inherit from builtin classes can now be serialized to
  custom representations.
- Kubernetes configuration values now serialize to human readable values instead
  of numerics.
- Multicheck expanded methods are now filterable and taggable.
- Progress logging and reporting will no longer trigger unhandled exceptions.
- Adjust operations now return a state descriptor rather than parroting back the
  requested state.
- Kubernetes Connector is now aware of out of band changes such as those made by
  Horizontal Pod Autoscalers.

## [0.7.0] "nice for what?" - 2020-09-09

### Added

- `servo run --check` can now be controlled via the `SERVO_RUN_CHECK`
  environment variable.
- The `servo.logging` module now provides the `set_colors` function for
  programmatically enabling or disabling coloring.
- The CLI accepts a `â€”no-colors` argument that will explicitly disable coloring.
- The `SERVO_NO_COLOR` and `NO_COLOR` environment variables are respected to
  disable coloring.
- The API URL can be now be overridden via the hidden `--url` CLI option or the
  `OPSANI_URL` environment variable.
- Introduce the `multicheck` decorator for use in checks implementations. A
  multicheck is method that returns an iterable collection of checkable objects
  and a `CheckHandler` callable that can evaluate each item. Each item in the
  iterable collection is wrapped into an individual check and run independently.
  This provides a simple mechanism for checking configurations that have a mix
  of settings that need to be handled specifically and homogenous collections
  that can be handled iteratively. The generated checks are filterable and fully
  integrated with the CLI.
- Checks and multichecks now support templated string inputs. The `self` and
  `item` arguments are made available as format variables, enabling the names
  and descriptions given to the decorators to produce dynamic, contextual values
  from the configuration. This enhances the readability and diagnostic context
  of the checks output.
- The Prometheus connector now exposes a rich set of checks.
- The Prometheus connector now accepts an optional list of targets that are
  expected to be scraped.

### Changed

- Log coloring is now conditionally enabled via TTY auto-detection.

### Fixed

- Handle measure command responses that include metric units (`oco-e`
  compatibility).
- Prometheus can now connect to localhost URLs.
- The `get_instance_methods` utility function now returns instance methods that
  are bound to a specific object instance

## [0.6.2] - 2020-09-03

### Changed

- Switched Docker base image to `python:3.8-slim`.

## [0.6.1] - 2020-09-03

### Enhanced

- Logging when connecting via a proxy.

### Fixed

- Handled null annotations and labels when cloning a Deployment in order to
  create a Pod.
- Servo runner now honors proxy settings (previously only honored within
  connectors).
- `servo check servo` now works as expected (previously not handled as a
  connector name).

### Changed

- Updated to httpx v0.14.3.

## [0.6.0] "woke up like this" - 2020-08-30

### Enhanced

- The checks subsystem has been rearchitected to streamline the development of
  checks and provide a better operational experience for running and debugging
  checks.

### Added

- `servo run --check` will run all configured checks before starting the servo
  runloop.
- `servo check` now supports filtering by name, id, and tags. Failure mode
  handling is configurable via `--halt-on-failed=[requirement,check,never]`
- `servo run` now applies exponential backoff and retry to recover from
  transient HTTP errors.
- Introduce associations mixin for managing off-model support objects that don't
  make sense to model as attributes.
- `ServoConfiguration` class for applying settings to the servo itself.
- HTTP proxy support (configured on `ServoConfiguration`).
- Timeout configuration (configured on `ServoConfiguration`).
- Support for configuring backoff and retry behaviors (configured on
  `ServoConfiguration`).
- Baseline set of checks on the Kubernetes Connector.

### Fixed

- Attempting to connect to an invalid or unavailable optimizer backend now
  triggers exponential backoff and retry rather than crashing.
- Encountering an unexpected event error from the optimizer now aborts the
  operation in progress and resets rather than waiting for the operation to
  complete.

## [0.5.1] - 2020-08-23

### Removed

- Migrated servo-webhooks into a standalone project (see
  [opsani/servo-webhooks](https://github.com/opsani/servo-webhooks))

## [0.5.0] - 2020-08-22

### Added

- The capabilities of the logging module have been significantly enhanced with
  supporting for changing the logging levels, performing timed logging around
  methods, and attaching backtraces.
- Log messages are now annotated with the event context when logging occurs
  during an event handler.
- The metadata decorator now accepts a tuple for the `name` parameter for
  providing an explicit default name for connectors of the decorated type,
  overriding the name inference.
- Progress can be automatically reported to the Opsani API by annotating log
  messages with a "progress" key.
- Introduced general utilities for executing subprocesses including streaming
  output, timeouts, etc.
- Added integration testing infrastructure for testing the servo in Docker,
  Minikube, and EKS.
- Integrated complete implementation of Kubernetes connector on top of
  kubernetes_asyncio.

### Changed

- Enable parsing of extended Golang duration strings in `Duration` (days, weeks,
  months, years).
- The base connector class has been renamed from `Connector` to `BaseConnector`
  to align with other inheritance patterns in the library.
- Redesigned the Kuberenetes configuration to adopt familiar naming conventions
  and structure from Kubernetes.

## [0.4.2] - 2020-07-24

### Fixed

- The init command output formatting was broken when accepting defaults.

## [0.4.1] - 2020-07-24

### Fixed

- The `respx` mocking library was in the main project dependencies instead of
  dev dependencies.

## [0.4.0] - 2020-07-24

The headline feature of this release is the adoption of asyncio as a core part
of the architecture.

### Fixed

- Docker image builds now correctly support excluding development dependencies
  via the `SERVO_ENV` build argument.

### Added

- Docker images are now published to Docker Hub with README content from
  `docs/README-DOCKERHUB.md`.
- Introduced Duration class for modeling time durations as Golang style duration
  strings.
- BaseConfiguration now provides a `yaml` method for easily to YAML.
- BaseConfiguration now provides a `json_encoders` static method for easily
  accessing the default encoders.
- The Vegeta connector now validates the `target` and `targets` settings.
- The check command now supports a verbose and non-verbose modes for outputting
  multiple checks from a connector.
- The version command can now output version data for connectors.
- The connectors command now outputs names for displaying aliased
  configurations.
- The servo now runs asynchronously on top of asyncio.
- Added start-up banner to run command.

### Removed

- The `durationpy` package has been removed in favor of a local implementation.

### Changed

- Updated Docker and Docker Compose configurations to use `/servo/opsani.token`
  as the default path for API tokens mounted as a file.
- Docker images pushed to Docker Hub are now built with `SERVO_ENV=production`
  to exclude development packages.
- The reporting interval is now configurable `VegetaConfiguration`.
- The check event now returns a list of checks instead of one result.
- Removed the 'Connector' suffix from the default connector name attribute and
  introduced `full_name`.
- The `__config_key__` attribute has been renamed to `__default_name__`.
- The identifier for connectors has been renamed to `name` for simplicitly and
  clarity.
- The `ServoAssembly` class has been renamed to `Assembly`.

## [0.3.1] - 2020-07-16

  configmap`).
- All Connectors can now dispatch events (previously only available to the
  `Servo` class).

  release, Docker builds).

### Removed

- Removed `ServoAssembly.default_routes` from the API (usage eliminated).

### Changed

- Normalized naming of miscellaneous config methods.
- Renamed `ServoAssembly.all_connectors` to `ServoAssembly.all_connector_types`
  for clarity.

### Fixed

- Pydantic will no longer see self-references between connectors (avoids
  recursion sharp edge).

## [0.2.5] - 2020-07-13

### Fixed

- Dotenv was non-functional in PyPI release package.

## [0.2.1] - 2020-07-13

### Fixed

- Worked around package naming conflict.

## [0.2.0] - 2020-07-13

Initial public release.

There is quite a bit of functionality available. Please consult the README.md at
the root of the repository for details. The major limitations at the moment are
around porting of connectors to the new architecture. At the moment a connectfor
for the Vegeta load generator and Kubernetes resource management are bundled in
the distribution. The connector catalog will expand rapidly but porting does
involve some effort in order to leverage the full value of the new system.

### Added

- Configuration management. Generate, validate, and document configuration via
  JSON Schema.
- Support for dispatching events for communicating between connectors.
- Initial support for check, describe, measure, and adjust operations.
- Vegeta and Kubernetes connectors for testing load generation and adjustments.
- Init command for setting up an assembly.
- Informational commands (`servo show [metrics | events | components]`).
- Foundational documentation within the code and in the README.md at the root of
  the repository.
- Assets for running a containerized servo under Kubernetes or Docker / Docker
  Compose.
