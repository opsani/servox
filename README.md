This repository contains the source code of the Opsani Servo agent.

The servo connects applications to the Opsani cloud optimization engine
to identify cost savings and performance enhancements by applying machine
learning technology. Servos are lightweight Python applications and are
typically deployed as a container under an orchestration layer such as
Kubernetes, ECS, or Docker Compose.

Servos are composed of connectors, which provide the core functionality for
integrating with metrics, orchestration, and load generation systems/utilities.
The ServoX codebase provides core functionality shared by all servos and a rich
library supporting the development of connectors.

## Quick Start

ServoX is a modern Python application distributed as an installable Python
package. Development is done in a Python install managed with
[Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and a virtual environment managed by
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). This is the path of least resistance but
any Python package management system should work.

* Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:opsani/servox`
* Install required Python: `cd servox && pyenv install`
* Install Poetry: `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py |
  python`
* Link Poetry with pyenv version: ``poetry env use `cat .python-version` ``
* Install dependencies: `poetry install`
* Activate the venv: `poetry shell`
* Initialize your environment: `servo init`
* Start interacting with the servo: `servo --help`

## Overview

### Getting Started with Opsani

Access to an Opsani optimizer is required to deploy the servo and run the end to
end integration tests. If you do not currently have access to an Opsani
environment but are otherwise interested in working with the optimizer and
Servo, please reach out to us at [info@opsani.com](mailto:info@opsani.com) and
we will get back with you.

### Usage

#### Displaying Help

```console
❯ servo --help
```

#### Initializing an Assembly

**NOTE**: A Dotenv file is recommended during development to keep the CLI
options under control. The init command will generate one for you.

```console
❯ servo init
```

#### Configuration

```console
# Generate a config file with all available connectors
❯ servo generate

# Validate a config file
❯ servo validate

# Display config schema
❯ servo schema
```

#### Displaying Info

```console
# Display all available connectors
❯ servo connectors

# Display instance specific info (requires configuration)
❯ servo show connectors
❯ servo show events
❯ servo show components
❯ servo show metrics
```

#### Running Operations

```console
# Check servo readiness
❯ servo check

# Describe application state
❯ servo describe

# Capture and display a measurement
❯ servo measure

# Adjust the memory of web-server to 512MB and cpu of gateway to .8 millicores
❯ servo adjust web.mem=512 gateway.cpu=0.8

# Run the servo to start optimizing
❯ servo run
```

## Architecture

ServoX has been designed to provide a delightful experience for engineers
integrating cloud optimization into their systems and workflow. Developer
ergonomics and operator efficiency are primary concerns as integrating and
orchestrating disparate components can quickly become tiresome and complex. As a
library, ServoX aspires to be as "batteries included" as possible and support
developers with well designed, implemented, and tested solutions for common
concerns. As a tool, ServoX strives to support system operators and devops
engineers with strong support for common tasks and a high-velocity workflow.

There are a few key components that form the foundation of the architecture:

* **Connectors** - Connectors are pluggable components that enable the servo to
  interact with external systems such as metrics providers (Prometheus, Datadog,
  New Relic, etc), orchestration technologies (Kubernetes, cloud provider APIs,
  etc), or load generators. Every major functional component (including the
  servo itself) is a connector that inherits from the `Connector` base class.
  Connectors can process events dispatched from the servo (see Events below),
  provide services to the user (see CLI below), and interact with other
  connectors.
* **Servo** - The Servo class models the active set of connectors and
  configuration that is executing. The servo handles connectivity with the
  Opsani Optimizer API (see Optimizer below) and is responsible for the primary
  concerns of connectivity management and event handling.
* **Configuration** - Configuration is a major shared concern in tools such as
  Opsani that are designed to integrate with arbitrary systems. Ensuring that
  configuration is valid, complete, and functional is a non-trivial task for any
  component with more than a few knobs and levers. ServoX provides a rich
  configuration subsystem built on Pydantic that makes modeling and processing
  configuration very straightforward. Out of the box support is provided for
  common needs such as environment variables and dotenv files. Configuration is
  strongly validated using JSON Schema and support is provided for generating
  config files directly from the connectors.
* **Optimizer** - The Optimizer class represents an Opsani optimization engine
  that the servo interacts with via an API. The optimizer can be configured via
  CLI arguments, from the environment, or via assets such as Kubernetes secrets.
* **Events** - The Event subsystem provides the primary interaction point
  between the Servo and Connectors in a loosely coupled manner. Events are
  simple string values that have connector defined semantics and can optionally
  return a result. The Servo base class defines the primary events of
  `DESCRIBE`, `MEASURE`, `ADJUST`, and `PROMOTE` which correspond to declaring
  the metrics & components that the connector is interested in, taking
  measurements and returning normalized scalar or time series data points,
  making changes to the application under optimization, or promoting an
  optimized configuration to the broader system.
* **Checks** - Checks provide a mechanism for verifying the correctness and
  health of connector configuration and operations. They are designed to support
  a high throughput integration and debugging experience by providing feedback
  loop driven workflow. Checks are implemented on top of the events subsystem
  and provide a rich interface via the `servo check` CLI command. The design of
  the checks subsystem is covered in depth [in the docs](docs/checks.md).
* **Assembly** - The Servo Assembly models the runtime environment of the servo
  outside of a particular configuration. The assembly is the parent of the servo
  and is responsible for "assembling" it by instantiating connectors as
  configured by the operator. Connectors can be used multiple times (e.g. you
  may want to connect to multiple discrete Prometheus services) or may not be
  used at all (e.g. you have a New Relic connector in the container image but
  aren't using it).
* **CLI** - The CLI provides the primary interface for interacting with the
  servo. The CLI is modular and contains a number of root level commands and
  connectors can optionally register additional commands. Most of the root level
  commands are driven through the event subsystem and connectors which respond
  to the relevant events will automatically become accessible through the CLI.
  For example, executing `servo schema` will emit a complete JSON Schema
  document for the assembly while `servo schema kubernetes` will emit a JSON
  Schema specific to the Kubernetes connector.

### Understanding Events

The servo is built around an event driven architecture and utilizes a
lightweight eventing system to pass messages between connectors. Eventing is
implemented in asynchronous Python on top of asyncio. Events are simple strings
identifiers that are bound to a Python
[inspect.Signature](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.Signature)
object. The signature is used when event handlers are registered to enforce a
contract around the parameter and return types, method arity, etc.

Any connector can define an event provided that no other connector has already
registered an event with the desired name. The `Servo` class defines several
basic events covering essential functionality such as declaring metrics and
components, capturing measurements, and performing adjustments. These events are
integrated into the CLI and readily accessible. For example, executing `servo
show metrics` dispatches the `metrics` event to all active connectors and
displays the aggregate results in a table. More substantial commands such as
`measure` and `adjust` work in the same manner -- dispatching events and
visualizing the results. Whenever possible functionality is implemented via
eventing.

When the servo is run, it connects to the Opsani optimizer via the API and
receives instructions about which actions to take to facilitate the optimization
activity. These commands are dispatched to the connectors via events.

The default events are available on the `servo.servo.Events` enumeration and
include:

| Event | Category | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| startup | Lifecycle | Dispatched when the servo is assembled. |
| shutdown | Lifecycle | Dispatched when the servo is being shutdown. |
| metrics | Informational | Dispatched to gather the metrics being measured. |
| components | Informational | Dispatched to gather the components & settings available for adjustment. |
| check | Operational | Asks connectors to check if they are ready to run by validating settings, etc. |
| describe | Operational | Gathers the current state of the application under optimization. |
| measure | Operational | Takes a measurement of target metrics and reports them to the optimizer. |
| adjust | Operational | Applies a change to the components/settings of the application under optimization and reports status to the optimizer. |

#### Event Handlers & Prepositions

Event handlers are easily registered via a set of method decorators available on
the `servo.connector` module. Handlers are registered with a *preposition* which
determines if it is invoked before, on, or after the event has been processed.
Handlers are invoked when the servo or another connector dispatches an event.
Event handlers can be implemented either synchronously or asynchronously
depending on if the method is a coroutined declared with the async prefix.

```python
from typing import List
import servo


class SomeConnector(servo.BaseConnector):
    @servo.before_event('measure')
    def notify_before_measure(self) -> None:
        self.logger.info("We are about to measure...")

    @servo.on_event('metrics')
    def metrics(self) -> List[servo.Metric]:
        return [servo.Metric('throughput', servo.Unit.REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE)]

    @servo.after_event('adjust')
    def analyze_results(self, results: List[servo.EventResult]) -> None:
        self.logger.info(f"We got some results: {results}")
```

Each preposition has different capabilities available to it. Before event
handlers can cancel the execution of the event by raising a `EventCancelledError`.
On event handlers can return results that are aggregated and available for
processing. After event handlers get access to all of the results returned by
active connectors via the on event handlers.

#### Creating a new Event

Events can be created either programmatically via the `Connector.create_event()`
class method or declaratively via the `event()` decorator:

```python
import servo


class EventExample(servo.BaseConnector):
    @servo.event()
    async def trace(self, url: str) -> str:
        ...
```

The `event` decorator uses the parameters and return type of the decorated
method to define the signature requirements for on event handlers registered
against the event. The body of the decorated method must be `...`, `pass`, or an
async generator that yields `None` exactly once.

The body of the decorated method can be used to define setup and tear-down
activities around on event handlers. This allows for common setup and tear-down
functionality to be defined by the event creator. This is achieved by
implementing the body of the decorated method as an async generator that yields
control to the on event handler:

```python
from typing import AsyncIterator
import servo


class SetupAndTearDownExample(servo.BaseConnector):
    @servo.event()
    async def trace(self, url: str) -> AsyncIterator[str]:
        print("Entering event handler...")
        yield
        print("Exited event handler.")
```

The event decorator can also be used to create an event and register a handler
for the event at the same time. In this example, the `handler=True` keyword
argument is provided to created the event **and** register the decorated method
as an on event handler for the new event.

```python
import servo


class AnotherConnector(servo.BaseConnector):
    @servo.event('load_test', handler=True)
    async def run_load_test(self, url: str, duration: int = 60) -> str:
        return "Do something..."
```

Once an event is created, the connector can dispatch against it to notify other
connectors of changes in state or to request data from them.

#### Dispatching an Event

Connectors can notify or interact with other connectors by dispatching an event.
When the servo is assembled, an event bus is transparently established between
the connectors to facilitate event driven interaction.

```python
from typing import List
import servo


class ExampleConnector(servo.BaseConnector):
    async def do_something(self) -> None:
        # Gather metrics from other connectors
        results: List[servo.EventResult] = await self.dispatch_event("metrics")
        for result in results:
            print(f"Gathered metrics: {result.value}")
```

### Environment Variables & Dotenv

Pay attention to the output of `servo --help` and `servo schema` to identify
environment variables that can be used for configuration. The servo handles
configuration of deeply nested attributes by building the environment variable
mapping on the fly at assembly time.

For convenience, the `servo` CLI utility automatically supports `.env` files for
loading configuration and is already in the `.gitignore`. Interacting with the
CLI is much cleaner if you drop in a dotenv file to avoid having to deal with
the options to configure the optimizer. The `servo init` command will help set
this up interactively.

### Logging

The servo base library provides logging services for all connectors and core
components. By default, the `servo` CLI utility runs at the `INFO` log level
which is designed to provide balanced output that informs you of what is
happening operationally without becoming overwhelming and pedantic. During
development, debugging, or troubleshooting it may become desirable to run at an
elevated log level. The log level can be set via a commandline option on the
`servo` utility or via the `SERVO_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable. The servo
will emit ANSI colored output to `stderr` when the terminal is a TTY. Coloring
can be suppressed via the `--no-color` commandline option or with the
`SERVO_NO_COLOR` or `NO_COLOR` environment variables.

```console
  -l, --log-level [TRACE|DEBUG|INFO|SUCCESS|WARNING|ERROR|CRITICAL]
                                  Set the log level  [env var:
                                  SERVO_LOG_LEVEL; default: INFO]
  --no-color                      Disable colored output  [env var:
                                  SERVO_NO_COLOR, NO_COLOR]
```

By default, log messages are written to `stderr` and a file sink at the `logs/`
subdirectory relative to the servo root. Backtraces are preformatted and as much
context as possible is provided when an exception is logged.

The `servo.logging` module exposes some interesting functionality for operators
and developers alike. Logging is aware of the eventing subsystem and will
automatically attribute log messages to the currently executing connector and
event context. Long running operations can be automatically reported to the
Opsani API by including a `progress` key with a numeric percentage value ranging
from 0.0 to 100.0. There are several function decorators available that can
provide automatic logging output for entry and exit, execution timing, etc.

Dependent libraries such as `backoff` have been configured to emit their logs
into the servo logging module. Every component that has logging support is
intercepted and handled by the logging subsystem and conforms to the log levels
outlined above.

### Connector Discovery

Connectors are set up to be auto-discovered using the setuptools entry point
functionality available from the Python standard library. When a new connector
is installed into the assembly, it will be automatically discovered and become
available for interaction.

The specific of how this mechanism works is discussed in detail on the [Python
Packaging
Guide](https://packaging.python.org/guides/creating-and-discovering-plugins/).

The bundled connectors are registered and discovered using this mechanism via
entries in the `pyproject.toml` file under the
`[tool.poetry.plugins."servo.connectors"]` stanza.

### Running Multiple Connector Instances

ServoX is designed to support assemblies that contain an arbitrary number of
connectors that may or may not be active and enable the use of multiple
instances of a connector with different settings. This introduces a few modes of
configuration.

The servo looks to a `connectors` configuration key that explicitly declares
which connectors are active within the assembly. If a `connectors` key is not
present in the config file, then all available connectors become optionally
available based on the presence or absence of their default configuration key.
For example, an assembly that includes New Relic, Datadog, and SignalFX
connectors installed as Python packages with the following configuration would
only activate Datadog due to the presence of its configuration stanza:

```yaml
datadog:
  setting_1: some value
  setting_2: another value
```

This mode supports the general case of utilizing a small number of connectors in
"off the shelf" configurations.

From time to time, it may become necessary to connect to multiple instances of a
given service -- we have seen this a few times with Prometheus in canary mode
deployments where metrics are scattered across a few instances. In these cases,
it can become necessary to explicitly alias a connector and utilize it under two
or more configurations. In such cases, the `connectors` key becomes required in
order to disambiguate aliases from configuration errors. In such cases, the
`connectors` key can be configured as a dictionary where the key identifies the
alias and the value identifies the connector:

```yaml
connectors:
  prom1: prometheus
  prom2: prometheus

prom1:
  setting_1: some value
  setting_2: another value

prom2:
  setting_1: some value
  setting_2: another value
```

It is also possible to utilize the `connectors` key in order to exclude
connectors from the active set. This can be done with the dictionary syntax
referenced above or using an array syntax if aliasing is not being utilized. For
example, given a configuration with New Relic and Prometheus active but some
sort of issue warranting the isolation of Prometheus from the active set, the
config file might be configured like:

```yaml
connectors:
  - new_relic

prometheus:
  setting_1: some value
  setting_2: another value

new_relic:
  setting_1: some value
  setting_2: another value
```

These configurations can be generated for you by providing arguments to `servo
generate`. A space delimited list of connector names will explicitly populate
the `connectors` key and a syntax of `alias:connector` will configure aliases:

```console
❯ servo generate foo:vegeta bar:kubernetes
bar:
  description: Update the namespace, deployment, etc. to match your Kubernetes cluster
  namespace: default
connectors:
  bar: kubernetes
  foo: vegeta
foo:
  description: Update the rate and target/targets to match your load profile
  duration: 5m
  rate: 50/1s
  target: https://example.com/

Generated servo.yaml
```

### Running Multiple Servos

ServoX is capable of running multiple servos within the same assembly and servos
can be added and removed dynamically at runtime. This is useful for optimizing
several applications at one time from a single servo deployment to simplify
operations or more interestingly to support the integration and automation of
optimization into CI and CD pipelines. For example, it is possible to configure
the build system to trigger optimization for apps as they head into staging or
upon emergence into production.

Multi-servo execution mode is straightforward. When the `servo.yaml` config file
is found to contain multiple documents (delimited by `---`), a servo instance is
constructed for each entry in the file and added to the assembly. There are
however a few differences in configuration options.

When multi-servo mode is enabled, the `--optimizer`, `--token`, `--token-file`,
`--base-url`, and `--url` options are unavailable. The optimizer and
connectivity configuration must be provided via the `optimizer` stanza within
each configuration *document* in the config file. The CLI will raise errors if
these options are utilized with a multi-servo configuration because they are
ambiguous. This does not preclude a single servo being promoted into a
multi-servo configuration at runtime -- it is a configuration resolution
concern.

When running multi-servo, logging is changed to provide context about the servo
that is active and generating the output. The `servo.current_servo()` method
returns the active servo at runtime.

Because ServoX is based on `asyncio` and functions as an orchestrator, it is
capable of managing a large number of optimizations in parallel (we have tested
into the thousands). Most operations performed are I/O bound and asynchronous
but the specifics of the connectors used in a multi-servo configuration will
have a significant impact on the upper bounds of concurrency.

#### Configuring Multi-servo Mode

Basically all that you need to do is use the `---` delimiter to create multiple
documents within the `servo.yaml` file and configure an `optimizer` within
each one. For example:

```yaml
---
optimizer:
  id: newco.com/awesome-app1
  token: 6686e4c3-2c6a-4c28-9c87-b304d7c1427b
connectors: [vegeta]
vegeta:
  duration: 5m
  rate: 50/1s
  target: GET https://app1.example.com/
---
optimizer:
  id: newco.com/awesome-app2
  token: 5d6e004d-cf7b-4121-b66f-d72f0fd44953
connectors: [vegeta]
vegeta:
  duration: 5m
  rate: 50/1s
  target: GET https://app2.example.com/
```

#### Adding & Removing Servos at Runtime

Servos can be added and removed from the assembly at runtime via methods on the
`servo.Assembly` class:

```python
import servo

assembly = servo.current_assembly()
new_servo = servo.Servo()
assembly.add_servo(new_servo)
assembly.remove_servo(new_servo)
```

### Extending the CLI

Should your connector wish to expose additional commands to the CLI, it can do
so via the `ConnectorCLI` class. Instances are automatically registred with the
CLI and the `Context` is configured appropriately when commands are invoked. All
CLI extensions are namespaced as subcommands to keep things tidy and avoid
naming conflicts.

A simple example of a CLI extension that will register `servo vegeta attack` is:

```python
import servo
import servo.cli
import servo.connectors.vegeta


cli = servo.cli.ConnectorCLI(servo.connectors.vegeta.VegetaConnector, help="Load testing with Vegeta")


@cli.command()
def attack(context: servo.cli.Context):
    """
    Run an adhoc load generation
    """
    context.connector.measure()
```

### Requirements & Dependencies

ServoX is implemented in Python and supported by a handful of excellent
libraries from the Python Open Source community. Additional dependencies in the
form of Python packages or system utilities are imposed by connectors (see
below).

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.6+ - ServoX makes liberal use of type
  hints to annotate the code and drive some functionality.
* [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) - Pydantic is a fantastic
  parsing and validation library that underlies most classes within ServoX. It
  enables the strong modeling and validation that forms the core of the
  configuration module.
* [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) - Typer provides a nice, lightweight
  enhancement on top of [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/) for
  building CLIs in Python. The CLI is built out on top of Typer.
* [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/) - httpx is a (mostly) requests
  compatible HTTP library that provides support for HTTP/2, is type annotated,
  has extensive test coverage, and supports async interactions on top of
  asyncio.
* [loguru](https://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) - A rich Python
  logging library that builds on the foundation of the standard library logging
  module and provides a number of enhancements.

## Development

### Contributing to ServoX

Open Source contributions are always appreciated. Should you wish to get
involved, drop us a line via GitHub issues or email to coordinate efforts.

It is expected that most Open Source contributions will come in the form of new
connectors. Should you wish to develop a connector, reach out to us at Opsani as
we have connector developer guides that are in pre-release while ServoX matures.

### Visual Studio Code

The core development team typically works in VSCode. Poetry and VSCode have not
quite yet become seamlessly integrated. For your convenience, there are a couple
of Makefile tasks that can simplify configuration:

* `make init` - Initialize a Poetry environment, configure `.vscode/settings.json`,
  and then run the `servo initialize command.
* `make vscode` - Export the Poetry environment variables and then open the
  local working copy within VSCode. The built-in terminal and Python extension
  should auto-detect the Poetry environment and behave.

### Pre-commit Hook

The project is configured with a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook to
enforce as much of the coding standards and style guide as possible. To install
it into your working copy, run:

```console
poetry run pre-commit install
```

### Developing with Local Packages

When developing against dependencies or building out new connectors, it can be
useful to utilize a local package so that development can be done in the
dependency and within the servox package at the same time.

To do so, utilize Poetry Path based dependencies with the `develop = true` flag
by adding a path reference to the package into the to `tool.poetry.dev-dependencies`
stanza of the `pyproject.toml` file, and then run `poetry update [dependency name]`.

For example, if developing on servox and the statesman state machine library in
a working copy in the parent directory, you would add:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
# ...
statesman = {path = "../statesman", develop = true}
```

And then run `poetry update statesman`.

Changes made to the dependency are immediately visible to servox, making it
easy to develop across package boundaries efficiently.

### Linting and Formatting

The project is structured to support and enforce consistent, idiomatic code. A
number of tools have been integrated to provide linting and automatic
reformatting when possible/appropriate.

This functionality is exposed via tasks in the `Makefile`, Git commit hooks, and
GitHub Actions.

During local development, you may wish to invoke these tools as follows:

* `make lint` - Run the linters and output actionable feedback for conformance
  with the engineering standards and style of the project.
* `make format` - Automatically apply changes to the working copy to conform
  with project standards where possible (e.g., reformatting imports).
* `make pre-commit` - Run all pre-commit hooks in the manual hook stage. There
  are a number of standards that are currently soft enforced in the interest of
  pragmatism. Eventually the set of pre-commit and lint checks will form a
  perfect union but we are not there yet. Most hooks set in manual mode have to
  do with fit and finish concerns such as docstring tone/formatting.
* `make test` - Execute the test suite and generate a code coverage report.

Linting is automatically performed when a new branch is pushed or a PR is opened
and conformance can be remediated during post-implementation code review.

### Connecting to Development APIs

By default, the servo will connect to the primary Opsani API hosted on
[https://api.opsani.com](https://api.opsani.com). This behavior can be
overridden via CLI options and environment variables:

| Option | Environment Variable | Description | Example |
|--------|----------------------|-------------|---------|
| `--base-url` | `OPSANI_BASE_URL` | Sets an alternate base URL. The path is computed using the optimizer. Useful for staging deployments and integration tests. | `servo --base-url https://staging-api.opsani.com:3456 run` |
| `--url` | `OPSANI_URL` | Sets an explicit URL target. When given, the base URL is ignored and paths are not computed. Useful in unit tests and workstation development with a partial server stack. | `servo --url http://localhost:1234  run` |

### Docker & Compose

`Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml` configurations are available in the
repository and have been designed to support both development and deployment
workflows. Configuration file mounts and environment variables can be used to
influence the behavior of the servo within the container.

The `SERVO_ENV` build argument controls the target environment for the built
image. Building with `SERVO_ENV=production` excludes development packages from
the image to reduce size and build time.

Pre-built Docker images are available on
[opsani/servox](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/opsani/servox) on
Docker Hub. The documentation for these images is available within this
repository at [docs/README-DOCKER_HUB.md](docs/README-DOCKER_HUB.md).

The latest release version is available under the `opsani/servox:latest` tag.
The `main` development branch is published as the `opsani/servox:edge` tag.

Docker images are built and published to Docker Hub via the
[Docker GitHub Actions Workflow](.github/workflows/docker.yaml). The workflow
builds branches, published releases, and the `main` integration branch. Pull
Requests are not published to Docker Hub because as a publicly available
repository it could become an attack vector.

Git branches and Docker images have differing naming constraints that impact how
tag names are computed. For example, Docker tags cannot contain slashes, which
is a common practice for namespacing branches and tags in Git. As such, slashes
are converted to hyphens when computing tag names for branches and tags. The
full naming constraints on Docker image tags is covered in the [`docker
tag`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag/#extended-description)
documentation.

Pre-built images are built using BuildKit and can be used as the basis for very
fast customized builds:

```console
❯ DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t servox --build-arg BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE=1 --cache-from opsani/servox:edge .
```

### Switching Python Interpreters

After changing Python interpreter versions you may find that you are "stuck" in
the existing virtual environment rather than your new desired version.

The problem is that Poetry is linked against the previous environment and needs
a nudge to select the new interpreter.

The project is bound to a local Python version via the `.python-version` file.
Tell Poetry to bind against the locally selected environment via:
``poetry env use `cat .python-version` ``

When upgrading between point releases of the Python interpreter, you may need
to tear down and recreate your venv:
``poetry env remove `cat .python-version` && poetry install``

## Testing

Tests are implemented using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) and
live in the `tests` subdirectory. Tests can be executed directly via the
`pytest` CLI interface (e.g., `pytest tests`) or via `make test`, which
will also compute coverage details.

ServoX is developed with a heavily test-driven workflow and philosophy. The
framework strives to provide as much support for robust testing as possible
and make things that you would think are very hard to test programmatically
very simple. You will want to familiarize yourself with what is available,
there are tools that can dramatically accelerate your development.

### Test Types

ServoX divides the test suite into three types: **Unit**, **Integration**, and
**System** tests.

Tests are identified within the suite in two ways:

1. Use of pytest markers to annotate the tests in code.
2. File location within the tests/ subdirectory.

Unit tests are the default type and make up the bulk of the suite. They either
exercise code that carries no outside dependencies or utilize isolation
techniques such as mocks and fakes. They are fast and highly effective for
validating defined behavior and catching regressions.

Integration tests do not interact with an Opsani Optimizer but do interact with
external systems and services such as Kubernetes and Prometheus. It is common to
utilize a local environment (such as Docker, Compose, kind, or Minikube) or a
dedicated cloud instance to host the services to interact with. But the focus of
the tests are on implementing and verifying the correct behaviors in a
supportive environment.

System tests are much like integration tests except that theyn are highly
prescriptive about the environment they are runnuing in and interact with a real
optimizer backend as much as is practical. System tests sit at the top of the
pyramid and it is expected that there are comparatively few of them, buit they
deliver immense value late in a development cycle when code correctness has been
established and deployment environments and compatibility concerns come to the
forefront.

All test types can be implemented within any test module as appropriate by
annotating the tests with pytest markers:

```python
import pytest


@pytest.mark.integration
class TestSomething:
    ...
```

Tests without a type mark are implicitly designated as unit tests for
convenience. When multiple type marks are in effect due to hierarchy, the
closest mark to the test node has precedence.

There are also dedicated directories for integration and system tests at
`tests/integration` and `tests/system` respectively. These dedicated directories
are home to cross cutting concerns and scenarios that do not clearly belong to a
specific module. Tests in these directories that are marked with other types
will trigger an error.

### Running Tests

A key part of any testing workflow is, well, running tests. pytest provides a
wealth of capabilities out of the box and these have been further augmented with
custom pytest-plugins within the suite.

Let's start with the basics: executing `pytest` standalone will execute the unit
tests in `tests`. Running `pytest --verbose` (or -v) will provide a one test per
line output which can be easier to follow in slower runs.

Individual files can be run by targetting them by name: `pytest
tests/connector_test.py`. Individual test functions and container test classes
within the file (known as nodes in pytest parlance) can be addressed with the
`tests/path/to/test_something.py::TestSomething::test_name` syntax.

Tests can also be flexibly selected by marks and naming patterns. Invoking
`pytest -m asyncio -k sleep` will select all tests with the asyncio mark and
have the word "sleep" in their name. These arguments support a matching syntax,
look into the pytest docs for details.

The ServoX test types have specific affordances exposed through pytest. Running
`pytest -T integration` will select and run all integration tests, but deselect
all other types. The `-T` also known as `--type` flag supports stem matching for
brevity: `pytest -T u` will select the unit tests.

Because they are slow and require supplemental configuration, integration and
system tests are skipped by default. They can be enabled via the
`-I, --integration` and `-S, --system` switches, respectively. Note the difference
in behavior between the flags: `pytest -I -S` will result in all the tests being
selected for run whereas `pytest -T sys` targets the system tests exclusively.
Once the `-I, -S` flags have been used to enable the tests, they can be further
filtered using `-m` and `-k`. If you are thoughtful about how you name your
tests and leverage marks when it makes sense, it can become very easy to run
interesting subsets of the suite.

By default, pytest uses output buffering techniques to capture what is written
to stdout and stderr. This can become annoying if you are trying to introspect
state, print debugging info, or get a look at the servo logs. You can suppress
output capture via the `-s` switch. This is typically only recommended when
running a small number of tests because the output quickly becomes
incomprehensible.

If you are working through a set of failures, you can rerun the tests that
failed on the last run via the `--lf, --last-failed` flag. The `--ff,
--failed-first` flag will rerun all of the tests, but run the previously failed
tests first. Similarly, `--nf, --new-first` will run the full suite but
prioritize new files. The `pytest-picked` plugin provides additional targeting
based on git working copy status -- running `pytest --picked` will find unstaged
files to run.

Finally, the `--sw, --stepwise` and `--sw-skip, --stepwise-skip` flags allow you
to methodically working through a stack of failures by resuming from your last
failure and then halting at the next one.

### Makefile Tasks

Test automation tasks are centralized into the `Makefile`. There are a number of
testing  tasks availble including:

* `make test` - Run all available tests.
* `make test-unit` - Run unit tests.
* `make test-integration` - Run integration tests.
* `make test-system` - Run system tests.
* `make test-coverage` - Run all available tests and generate code coverage
  report.
* `make test-kubeconfig` - Generate a kubeconfig file at tests/kubeconfig. See
  details in [Integration Testing](#integration-testing) below.
* `make autotest` - Automatically run tests based on filesystem changes.

Testing tasks will run in subprocess distributed mode by default (see below).

### Integration Testing

The test suite includes support for integration tests for running tests against
remote system components such as a Kubernetes cluster or Prometheus deployment.
Integration tests require a [kubeconfig](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/)
file at `tests/kubeconfig`.

By convention, the default integration testing cluster is named `kubetest`
and the `make test-kubeconfig` task is provided to export the cluster details
from your primary kubeconfig, ensuring isolation.

Interaction with the Kubernetes cluster is supported by the most excellent
[kubetest](https://kubetest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library that provides
fixtures, markers, and various testing utilities on top of pytest.

To run the integration tests, execute `pytest -I` to enable the
marker. Integration tests are much slower than the unit test suite
and should be designed to balance coverage and execution time.

System tests are enabled by running `pytest -S`. Systems tests are very similar
to integration tests in implementation and performance, but differ in that they
are prescriptively bound to particular deployment environments and interact with
an actual

Tests can also be run in cluster by packaging a development container and
deploying it. The testing harness will detect the in-cluster state and utilize
the active service account.

### Continuous Integration

The project is configured to run CI on unit tests for all branches, tags, and
pull requests opened against the repository. CI for integration and system tests
is constrained by a few rules because they are so resource intensive and may be
undesirable during experimental developmenmt or integrating multiple branches
together.

Integration and system tests are run if any of the following conditions are
met:

* A push is made to `main`.
* A push is made to a branch prefixed with `release/`.
* A push is made to a branch prefixed with `bugfix/`.
* A tag is pushed.
* A push is made to a branch with an open pull request.
* The commit message includes `#test:integration` and/or
  `#test:system`.

The default unit test job that is executed for all pushes generates code
coverage reports and XML/HTML report artifacts that are attached to the run. The
integration and system test jobs report on the runtime duration of the tests to
help identify and manage runtime creep.

The unit, integration, and system test jobs all utilize the `pytest-xdist`
plugin to split the test suite up across a set of subprocesses. This is
discussed in the [Distributed Testing](#distributed-testing) section.

Docker images are built and pushed to Docker Hub automatically for all
pushed refs. Release tags are handled automatically and the
`opsani/servox:latest` tag is advanced when a new version is released. The
`main` branch is built and pushed to the `opsani/servox:edge` tag.

#### Distributed Testing

The project is configured to leverage locally distributed test execution by
default. Servo workloads are heavily I/O bound and spend quite a bit
of time awaiting data from external services. This characteristic makes tests
inherently slower but also makes them very well suited for parallel execution.
The `Makefile` tasks and GitHub actions are configured to leverage a subprocess
divide & conquer strategy to speed things up.

This functionality is provided by [pytest-xdist](https://docs.pytest.org/en/3.0.1/xdist.html).

### Manifest Templating

All manifests loaded through kubetest support Mustache templating.
A context dictionary is provided to the template that includes references to all
Kubernetes resources that have been loaded at render time. The `namespace` and
`objs` are likely to be the most interesting.

### Startup Banner

Just for fun, ServoX generates an ASCII art banner at startup. The font is
randomized from a painstakingly selected set of style that represent the ServoX
vibe. The output color is then randomized and has a 50/50 shot of being rendered
as a rainbow or a randomly selected flat output color.

Don't like serendipity?

You can take control of the banner output with two environment variables:

* `SERVO_BANNER_FONT`: Name of the [Figlet](http://www.figlet.org/fontdb.cgi)
  font to render the banner in.
* `SERVO_BANNER_COLOR`: The color to use when rendering the banner. Valid
  options are:
  * `RED`
  * `GREEN`
  * `YELLOW`
  * `BLUE`
  * `MAGENTA`
  * `CYAN`
  * `RAINBOW`
